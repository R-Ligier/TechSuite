## Project Overview
The React web app - TechSuite is a timeline or step by step career path for those entering the tech indistry and hope to become software engineers. 

I recall the time when I was a beginner and struggled to get myself up to speed with the demands of the tech workforce and wished it could have been simpler and different. TechSuite exist in hopes to change the way beginners and new comers prepare themselves to work in the industry.


## Project Building Structure
This project is built with ReactJS and is structured in a very similiar way to the structures that object oriented languages follow. 

Instead of "classes", React identifies these as "components". Each object (ex: button, timeline layout, etc ...) in this project is its own component. Some objects are instaniated in other objects. However, there is one file that renders the entire web app to appear with an instaniation of an object.


## Functionality / Technicalities
#### Each card element on the timeline is a task for a user to complete. The card element contains a task name, desciption of relevant to the type of task, a "View More" button containing the full content of the task, and a status button to set the status of task to - Incomplete, In Progress, or Complete.
